				<p>Education</p>
					<p>ProSolo represents the future model of education. The traditional model of education and training
					 has long been focused on a classroom centric process with formalised credentials being the domain for 
					 the higher education space. However, this process is being challenged with the growth of new and open 
					 education models. Increasingly, private, and public industry are now recognising the importance for all 
					 forms of learning from formal, to informal and workplace based. There is growing acknowledgement within 
					 and outside the education sector that the achievement of competencies, learning outcomes and awarding of 
					 credentials is not limited and cannot be limited to Universities and colleges alone.</p>
					<p><stron>ProSolo harnesses the transformative power of adaptive and personalized learning to unbundle degrees, 
					programs and courses and re-aggregate in new ways that better match each student’s learning needs, 
					interests and career goals</stron></p>
					<p>ProSolo provides all learners with the ability to personalize their education experience. There has been much 
					anticipation and debate around the capacity for technology to provide “adaptive and personalized learning”. Arguably, 
					ProSolo is the first integrated platform to provide learners the opportunity to customize, modify and personalize their 
					learning journey. At ProSolo we truly believe education is for everyone and learning occurs everywhere. ProSolo’s unique 
					design and conceptual model truly captures the essence of personalized learning. ProSolo’ provides users with the ability to 
					unbundle education programs, courses and units into discrete yet inter-related competencies to allow learners to construct their 
					education pathway that better reflect their interests and future career motivations and requirements. </p>
					<p></p>The growth of informal learning opportunities such as Massive Open Online Courses and their associated certifications 
					has forced universities to rethink the processes for credentialing and learning to establish more flexible models for 
					recognizing alternate educational pathways. ProSolo’s mapping of learning goals and experiences directly to the achievement 
					of competencies provides learners with greater flexibility in their study options, as well as the recognition of alternate 
					learning pathways and prior experience. For education providers ProSolo maps curriculum activities directly to learner 
					competencies and outcomes allowing for easy unbundling and reassembling of degree programs and courses. ProSolo unpacks 
					the rigidity of existing programs to cater for alternate educational pathways and provide students with new opportunities to
					 gain recognition for prior and alternate credentials and experiences. ProSolo doesn’t just break the concept of the credit hour 
					  - it totally removes it.

					<p>Organisational learning</p>	
					<p>The nature of work is rapidly changing. Careers and job profiles that have previously lasted for decades are now redundant 
					or regularly morphed into new profiles requiring added or alternate skills and knowledge. It is not uncommon for individuals 
					to multiple jobs across varying fields over the duration of their working lives. For organizations, managing, developing and 
					tracking knowledge of the competencies of employees is a critical business process. An organization’s capacity for resilience 
					and adaptivity to respond to new opportunities stems from the knowledge and skills of its employees.</p>
					<p>How individuals prepare for new careers is changing as well. Constant learning – in classrooms, on the job, lifelong – 
					is central to employability. The worlds of formal and informal learning converge on competencies. On demonstrating what 
					individuals can do and can learn. ProSolo views competencies as the currency of the new economy and the future of work. 
					ProSolo enables organizations to exploit the benefits of social media for employees/ individuals to manage and share their 
					own competence development, capturing formal training as well as skills learned on the job or informally, thereby increasing 
					organizational awareness of skills available and aiding career path development. ProSolo’s software allows companies and individuals 
					to develop, track, manage, and validate all competencies, providing an organization-wide inventory and analysis as well as a way of 
					sharing competencies for various career paths.</p>
					<p>As formal training is only a small part of how employees develop and practice their competencies, 
					ProSolo makes competencies a collaborative and social activity to build enterprise knowledge awareness and capacity. 
					Unlike formal training sites focussed on capturing competency development solely from training interventions, ProSolo allows 
					competencies to be documented and validated through employee networks.</p>
